  My colleagues and I published a manuscript entitled [Additive design: the concept and data analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/wre.12317).

  As described above, this a method paper and it provided the R codes for data analysis using Rstudio. If someone is interested, please find the codes in this link below. If someone does not have data to practice the additive design exercice, you could also download the original data that I use in that manuscript.

   Making R codes availble is part of my Open Source Weed Sciene project. In the next posts, I will be including more R codes for data analysis of weed research studies.
